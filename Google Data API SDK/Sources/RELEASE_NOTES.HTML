<title>Release Notes</title>
    
<h1>This document lists the changes in the different releases</h1>

<h2>1.1.3.0</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Features</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Added conditional Get support. The service object has an overloaded Query method now,
        that allows you to pass a ifModifiedSince DateTime object into it.s</li>
        <li>Added Authsub token revocation support. There is a new method 
            revokeToken in AuthsubUtil, similiar to the java class library</li>
	        
    </ul>
    <li>Bugfixes/changes</li>
  	<li>Issue 93: ReFixed Title Exact Queries for Spreadsheets. Using 
        Title-Exact resulted in two question marks in the query string.</li>
  	<li>Fixed the GeoRSS where extension, which lived in a mistyped namespace.</li>
    <li>Fixed the Latitude property, which was misspelled Lattitude</li>
    <li>Added the Doclist assemblies to the setup program</li>s
    <li>Added MediaGroup.Contents as a Collection:  as there
        could be more than one. So all previous usages should be changed
        to access the first element in a collection. The old method will remain
        in there.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>


<h2>1.1.2.0</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Features</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The SpreadsheetEntry has a new property, Worksheets. This 
            property returns a WorksheetFeed object that can be used to 
            retrieve the Worksheets feed for a given Spreadsheet.</li>
        <li>The SpreadsheetEntry has a new property, WorksheetsLink. This 
            property returns a string that can be used to retrieve the 
            Worksheets feed uri for a given Spreadsheet.</li>
        <li>Added CreateBatchFeed to the Atomfeed object. This will create 
            a default batch feed for you, if the feed supports batching. The
            created batch feed will contain all currently dirty entries.</li>
        <li>Added a GDataBatchRequestException for that operation.</li>
        <li>Added Delete(Uri uir) to the service interface.</li>
        <li>Added more constructors to the CellEntry object, and moved 
            accessors for the CellEntry.Cell up to the CellEntry object. So 
            instead of writing CellEntry.Cell.Column, you can call 
            CellEntry.Column directly (and others).</li>
        <li>Added an index accessor to the CellFeed, you can now access 
            Cells on the CellFeed like this: CellEntry entry = CellFeed[1,1].
            This will retrieve not existing cells if needed.</li>
        <li>Added QueryCellFeed() and QueryCellFeedLink(ReturnEmptyCells 
            parameter) to the WorksheetEntry. The method with no parameters will
            get you the serverdefault cell feed.</li>
        <li>Added the CellFeedLink property on the WorksheetEntry. This 
            returns the URI to the CellFeed as string.</li>
        <li>Added an overloaded Insert method to the WorksheetFeed so that 
            you do not need to cast the return anymore.</li>
        <li>Added support for the Apps Migration API. The Google Apps Email Migration API 
	allows administrators and users of Google Apps to migrate mail from legacy 
	email systems into their domain's hosted Gmail accounts. 
	Your client application can upload email messages into these 
	accounts using standard Google data API feeds.</li>
	<li>Added the gapps_migration_sample: A simple application that demonstrates how to migrate 
		email messages to a Google Apps email account. See the readme file in the 
		samples/appsforyourdomain/migration directory for more details</li>
	        
    </ul>
    <li>Bugfixes/changes</li>
    <ul>
        <li>When an entry was copied from one feed to another, the internal 
            service object was set incorrectly.</li>
        <li>Added unittests for the new spreadsheet code.</li>
	<li>Issue 90: Corrected the override for Equals and GetHashCode for an EnumConstruct</li>
  	<li>Issue 93: Fixed Title Exact Queries for Spreadsheets</li>
  	<li>Issue 94: Fixed some incorrect Exception handlings</li>
    </ul>
</ul>


<h2>1.1.1.0</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Features</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Added an EventId property to the EventEntry object. This one 
            parses the atomId URI to just provided the EventId, which is used
            elsewhere (e.g., for recurring events).</li>
        <li>Added QueryAuthToken() on the service. If the Service is a 
            Google authenticated service, you can use this to obtain an 
            authentication token for ClientLogin</li>
        <li>Added CreatePicasaUri helper on the PicasaQuery classes to 
            create a Uri based on a userID</li>
	<li>Added new PhotoBrowser sample project. The resulting file PhotoTool.exe is produced
            using the ILMerge tool from Microsoft (free download). That way, PhotoTool.exe is 
            a standalone application with no further assembly dependencies. </li>

    </ul>
    <li>Bugfixes/Changes</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed the parsing of the OriginalEvent@id attribute. The 
            SimpleContainer parent class was broken in the sense that it did not
            call the generic parsing method at all. So all SimpleContainers 
            would not have read in attributes, luckily OriginalEvent was the
            only instance of this.</li>
        <li>Fixed the OriginalStartTime get/set method which was using the 
            wrong constant of the OriginalEvent object.</li>
        <li>Fixed the onclear() handler of the new extensionCollection base 
            class. It was incorrectly casting to When obects, which could cause
            a runtime error when called.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug in the simplecontainer class that could lead to an 
            exception if the extension list was empty</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug in Originalevent where the wrong prefix was 
            persisted, making saving an originalevent impossible</li>
        <li>Fixed NULL response object being used for authentication exceptions. 
            Now the correct object used for the authentication request is passed 
            to the exception.</li>
        <li>Changed the AuthException code to provide the status code 
            detail as well</li>
        <li>CalendarEntry did use the wrong namespace to find the location 
            object, hence retrieval of a calendar location was broken.</li>
        <li>Fixed ExtensionBase to not save NULL attributes as empty 
            strings. This could cause Picasa updates to fail.</li>
        <li>Fixed MediaGroup to allow the retrieval of multiple Thumbnails. 
            Introduced the ThumbnailCollection for this. To enable this, 
            SimpleContainer and AtomBase now implement IExtensionContainer, a
            common interface that encapsulates owning Extension elements.
            </li>
        <li> Added a default constructor to CalendarQuery so that you can 
            use it on .NET CF with a starting URI</li>
        <li>Changed the Reminder element to send an empty one to enable 
            creation of default Reminders in the calendar</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>1.1.0.0</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Features
	<ul>
	<li>
        added GZip support for .NET 1.1, 2.0 and .NET Compact Framework 2.0.
    </li>
    <li>
        added the ability to use authsubtokens to the ExecRequest utility (including 
        exchange of a onetime token to a session token). Just run ExecRequest for the 
        command line parameters, or read the help file page about it.
    </li>
 	<li>
        Support for Google Calendar WebContent Gadgets is included. A WebContent element 
        has a SortedList property to set and retrieve those preferences. See caltest.cs 
        for an example.
    </li>
   <li>
        Picasa support:
        <ul>
            <li>Added all media extensions (media:rss, exif and photo></li>
            <li>Added a PhotoEntry and PhotoFeed class that contain all of 
                those extensions</li>
            <li>Added unittests to query an album and insert a new photo</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
       <li> Added the QuickAdd feature for the Google Calendar. An EventEntry 
        has a QuickAdd boolean property. Setting it to true causes an insert to
        be treated like a quickAdd operation. 
    </li> 
 
	<li>Added the webcontentlink class to the Google Calendar Support to enable
		easier creation of Gadgets in calendars.</li>
		
	<li>Batch support for Google Calendar</li>
	<li>ASP .NET support for medium trust</li>
	
 	</ul></li>
 	
	<li>Changes and Bugfixes
    <ul>
    <li>
        Complete refactoring of Apps extension to use the new extension system
        (IExtensionElementFactory, AbstractEntry and AbstractFeed).
    </li>

	<li>
        To enable ASP.NET hosting in medium trust, we removed the usage of the 
        NetworkCredentials class. From now on, credentials are either passed as username/password, 
        or using the GDataCredentials. (issue 57)
    </li>
    <li>
        Changed "adminUserName" to "adminEmailAddress" in AppsService so that it's more 
        clear what information is actually required for this parameter.
    </li>

    <li>
        fixed a Google Base issue (The server doesn't accept scientific notations for 
        floats)
    </li>
    <li>
        fixed typo in the blogger sample (www..blogger), which made the sample hard to 
        use
    </li>
    
    <li>
        make the GAuthToken property of the GAuthRequestFactory public. It was 
        mistakenly marked internal, so that the token could not be retrieved by a client 
        application for caching.  
    </li>
    <li>
        fixed a parsing issue that resulted in Batch Upload hanging if an unknown 
        element was encountered
    </li>
    <li>
        added a helper method on AtomBase (entry and feed) to find exensionelements by 
        specifying a localname and an optional namespace (issue 81)
    </li>
    <li>
        the extension mechanism was reworked by creating an ExtensionElementFactory 
        interface that takes care of parsing elements. ElementFactories are registered 
        on the AtomBase (entry and feed) level.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed Issue 60, mulitple Reminders per Event. Note, that this introduces slight 
        changes when dealing with this. A new property, EventEntry.Reminders, was 
        created. The old property, EventEntry.Reminder, still exists, and only works on 
        the first Reminder in the list. Setting the old property will delete all 
        addtional reminders.The Reminders property is of type ArrayList (this is an 
        artifact of being .NET 1.1 compatible, once we move to .NET 2.0 or later, if 
        that ever happens, this could/should be typed).
    </li>
    <li>
        Modified data model for Spreadsheets worksheets to make it easier to change and 
        construct associated meta-data
    </li>
    <li>
        Added the ctz parameter to the EventQuery class. This parameter allows to 
        specify the timezone that is used to calculate start/end times for the returned 
        events
    </li>
    <li>
        Added an AlternateUri Property on the AtomEntry class. This property 
        returns the AtomUri of a rel=alternate type=html LINK entry. As this is 
        similiar to the ill named LINK helper on the spreadsheet entry, that 
        helper was removed, as they do serve the same purpose, and the link 
        helper was read only.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added an FeedUri Property on the AtomEntry class. This property 
        returns the AtomUri of a rel=#feed type=atom+xml LINK entry.
    </li>
     <li>
        Added an MediaUri Property on the AtomEntry class. This property 
        returns the AtomUri of a rel=#edit-media type=atom+xml LINK entry.
    </li>
    <li>Added new methods on the AtomCategory collection. Find searches for a
        category of a given term, or a term/scheme combination. Also changed the
        implementation of the Contains method to compare not just object
        fidelity, but also term/value pairs
        </li>
    <li>Added a ConvertToXSDSTring() helper in the Utilites class. As booleans 
        are represented as "True"/"False" in .NET, and xsd requires 
        "true"/"false" this helper takes care of that conversion.
        </li>
    <li>Added the ability to create custom AtomBase subclassed objects to 
        custom feeds/entries. Look at CreateAtomSubElement() in AtomBase. This
        is used to create custom clases like WebContentLink in the derived 
        services</li>
   </ul></li>

</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.9</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        added GBase support for m:adjusted_name and gm:adjusted_value inside attributes 
        (returned only when adjustments are enabled)
    <li>
        Google Apps changes:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Added new AppsService.createUser methods with hashed password support
            <li>
                Updated AppsException with new Google Apps error codes
            <li>
                Added the following properties to Login.cs: string hashFunctionName 
            <li>
                to hash user account password, bool agreedToTerms 
            <li>
                to see if the user has accepted the Google Apps Terms Of Service, bool admin 
            <li>
                to see if the user is a domain admin, bool changePasswordAtNextLogin 
            <li>
                to force the user to change password at next login
            <li>
                Updated unittests to test new properties
        </ul>
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.8</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        fixed a parsing bug in SpreadsheetService
    <li>
        fixed a bug in GDataRequestException that would prevent AppsException from 
        accessing the server's response.
    <li>
        modified AppsException to comply with new GDataRequestException
    <li>
        fixed a bug in CalculateBaseUri, that caused a crash if the passed in parameters 
        are all NULL. This caused composite feeds to not load if there was a comment 
        feed embedded
    <li>
        fixed a bug in the CalendarEventEntry, it was not parsing extendedProperties. 
        They are now parsed and added correctly to the ExtensionElements
    <li>
        added ACL support. This resulted in changes in the CalendarService.Query method 
    <li>
        as a CalendarService can now return an EventFeed or an AccessControlFeed is 
        returns now an AtomFeed that you can cast to what you are expecting. Added Query 
        overloads to accept EventQuery or AclQuery and return the appropriate Feeds
    <li>
        added a cmd line tool to query/insert/update to a service based on streams
    <li>
        modified the Spreadsheet service to use the new scheme of service subclassing. 
        This should fix a bundle of issues with regard to entry castings.
    <li>
        changed persistence of gd:extendedProperty to save the value attribute, even if 
        there is no data to persist
    <li>
        Added an ASP.NET release (lib/ASP.NET) where the DLLs are build with the 
        AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers attribute n enabled. Please use with caution and 
        refer to the readme.txt in that subdirectory for more information.
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.7</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        fixed an incorrect trace statement in request.cs that had the result of 
        disabling reading the error response.
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.6</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        added Google Apps for Your Domain support, a new helper DLL Google.GData.Apps.dll, 
        and a sample, as well as unittests. Version number is increased to distinguish 
        from Subversion, as this will be a binary download as well.
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.5</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        fix for incorrect encoding of usernames/passwords during authentication (you 
        could run into problems if you had an email like "foo&joe@test.com"
    <li>
        exposure of the accountType as a property on the factory. If you happen to have 
        an identical user name for a Google account and a hosted account, you need to 
        set this property depending on which account you want to access. Default is 
        GOOGLE_OR_HOSTED, other values are GOOGLE or HOSTED as strings.
    <li>
        fixed an issue with the edit/self uris on the entry. They were not correctly 
        setable.
    <li>
        fixed an issue that one you used an authenticated service, but did not supply 
        credentials, we would send an empty authentication header.
    <li>
        added Captcha Handling and more detailed exceptions when the authentication 
        request fails. See authexceptions.cs for the list of potential exceptions thrown
    <li>
        added some preliminary unittests for the new exceptions
    <li>
        added a new constructor for the TokenCollection, so that captcha parsing is 
        handled correctly
    <li>
        made the debug output depending on the TRACE define, and removed that define for 
        the release build
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.4</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Google Base: fix for incorrect Price attribute behaviour
    <li>
        Google Base: fix for incorrectly persisting duplicate attributes
    <li>
        Fix for Content.Type having no default value (issue 41)
    <li>
        Fix for Content.Type="text/html" parsing incorrectly. The strict check for type=
        "text" is now relaxed to be type="text*", so all text subtypes will be treated 
        the same
    <li>
        Fix for Content.Type = "html" and "text/html" persistence. What the code does 
        now is: first HTMLDecode the value held, than run the standard XMLWriter.WriteString 
        over it (which does HTML encoding). This seems to work fine.
    <li>
        Added the gm:stats tags to the Windows Mobile build, accidently forgot to change 
        that project file
    <li>
        the calendarfeed discarded entries unknown to it in the calendar namespace. This 
        is fixed now. Unknown entries to the parser are now correctly added to the 
        extension elements.
    <li>
        added the return-empty parameter to the cellquery class
    <li>
        added URL encoding to the authentication parameters (username/passwords etc that 
        had unallowed FORM post chars caused failed login attempts)
</ul>



<h2>1.0.9.3</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Google Base changes: New features:
        <ul>
            <li>
                GBaseQuery supports the following optional parameters; orderby, sortorder, 
                refine and content
            <li>
                Support for gm:stats tags
            <li>
                GBaseUriFactory can now generate the feed uri of other customers
                Fixes:
            <li>
                Fixed the GBaseAttributeType hierarchy for date/dateTime/dateTimeRange
            <li>
                Fixed the type of the hardcoded ExpirationDate property in GBaseAttributes
        </ul>
    <li>
        Added a Makefile for Mono builds. This one replaces the Ant file.
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.2</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Removed the MethodOverride default for the CalendarService. If you need that (due 
        to firewalls not allowing PUT/DELETE requests, you can reenable this with 
        setting the MethodOverride flag on the factory: ((GDataGAuthRequestFactory)calsvc.RequestFactory).MethodOverride 
        = false;
    <li>
        Changed the X-Method-Override behaviour for DELETE, to fix an issue with .NET 
        mobile (the mobile client would crash when the contentLength was set to 0 and no 
        stream was requested).
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.1</h2>
<li>
    Added a KeepAlive property to the factory object. This is set to true by default. 
    .NET 2.0 clients, are due to behaviour changes in that runtime encouraged to set 
    this to false.

    <h2>1.0.9</h2>
<li>
    Fixed an issue where the login services changed the response contenttype. The 
    check for text/plain is now more relaxed.
<li>
    Added the missing location calls for Geolocation for GoogleBase
<li>
    Fixed a build issue for Windows Mobile in release. The code now compiles for 
    PocketPC and WindowsMobile symbols defined.
    <h2>1.0.8</h2>
<li>
    Fixed issue 13 from the public issue list. If a content element contained xhtml, 
    and not just text, the content was not read correctly.
<li>
    Fixed issue 17 from the public issue list. XHTML content was not persisted 
    correctly.
<li>
    Added support for hosted domain feeds. This is done automatically, no 
    codechanges needed for the application developer. The authentication code was 
    changed to ask for Hosted domains first, then google accounts.
<li>
    Added support for the app:control/app:draft element, but only in the way to 
    expose a boolean on the AtomEntry. The new member on AtomEntry is called IsDraft.
<li>
    Changed the way atom:content is parsed. Text & HTML types use xmlreader.ReadString() 
    to get the inner content. XHTML and all other types use readInnerXml() to get 
    the content.
<li>
    changed Exception handling. The code now throws more detailed exceptions based 
    on what was happening: -> GDataRequestException: generic exception -> 
    GDataForbiddenException: exception thrown when the server return a Forbidden on 
    authentication -> GDataRedirectException: exception thrown when the server 
    returned a redirect
<li>
    changed redirect handling on Post. The library will follow redirects on Post 
    automatically by default, to accomodate Blogger (which currently may return 302s 
    on posts). This can be turned off by setting the .StrictRedirect property to 
    true on the GDataAuthRequestFactory. If it is turned off, the code will throw if 
    a redirect is happening on an HTTP verb other than GET.
<li>
