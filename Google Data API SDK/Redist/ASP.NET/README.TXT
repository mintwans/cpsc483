WARNING

Those assemblies here are identical to the assemblies in the Release directory, with the exception of being marked as PartiallyTrusted. If you 
do not know what this means, or what the potential implications are for your website, refer to MSDN and search for 

AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers 

to get the information you need to use this correctly. 

Note, while we believe that the Google Data assemblies follow security protocol, they do allow to call other websites directly, and hence 
it is up to you, the developer of the website, to make that final judgement call. The assemblies in this directory are provide as is, and
just as a matter of convienience, as it is easy enough to recompile the code yourself.
